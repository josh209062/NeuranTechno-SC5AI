## Results
### Model Performance
Describe all results found in your final project experiments, including hyperparameters tuning and architecture modification performances. Put it into table format. Please show pictures (of model accuracy, loss, etc.) for more clarity.

#### 1. Metrics
Inform your model validation performances, as follows:
- For classification tasks, use **Precision and Recall**.
- For object detection tasks, use **Precision and Recall**. Additionaly, you may also use **Intersection over Union (IoU)**.
- For image retrieval tasks, use **Precision and Recall**.
- For optical character recognition (OCR) tasks, use **Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER)**.
- For adversarial-based generative tasks, use **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PNSR)**. Additionally, for specific GAN tasks,
  - For single-image super resolution (SISR) tasks, use **Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)**.
  - For conditional image-to-image translation tasks (e.g., Pix2Pix), use **Inception Score**.

Feel free to adjust the columns in the table below.

| model | epoch | learning_rate | batch_size | optimizer | val_loss | val_precision | val_recall | ... |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vit_b_16 | 1000 |  0.0001 | 32 | Adam | 0.093 | 88.34% | 84.15% | ... |
| vit_l_32 | 2500 | 0.00001 | 128 | SGD | 0.041 | 90.19% | 87.55% | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 

#### 2. Ablation Study
Any improvements or modifications of your base model, should be summarized in this table. Feel free to adjust the columns in the table below.

| model | layer_A | layer_B | layer_C | ... | top1_acc | top5_acc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vit_b_16 | Conv(3x3, 64) x2 | Conv(3x3, 512) x3 | Conv(1x1, 2048) x3 | ... | 77.43% | 80.08% |
| vit_b_16 | Conv(3x3, 32) x3 | Conv(3x3, 128) x3 | Conv(1x1, 1028) x2 | ... | 72.11% | 76.84% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### 3. Training/Validation Curve
Insert an image regarding your training and evaluation performances (especially their losses). The aim is to assess whether your model is fit, overfit, or underfit.
 
### Testing
Show some implementations (demos) of this model. Show **at least 10 images** of how your model performs on the testing data.

### Deployment (Optional)
Describe and show how you deploy this project (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask), if any.

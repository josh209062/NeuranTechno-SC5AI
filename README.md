# ðŸ¥› Remilk Go: Various of milk Types Detection for Automated Smart Retail Monitoring System ðŸ¥›



## Project Description
Milk is a drink that is liked by many people, from children to adults. Milk is available in all existing supermarkets and minimarkets. Currently, the distribution of supermarkets and minimarkets is very wide, where we can find them on almost every street. Of the many activities carried out in supermarkets and minimarkets, the one that is often carried out by sales or employees is checking the availability of goods in supermarkets or minimarkets, one of which is milk products. Checking the availability of a dairy product in supermarkets, minimarkets or shops is an activity that is often carried out. Where in this activity, errors often occur when checking the stock of a dairy product. Moreover, when there is too much stock of dairy products being checked, this can result in human error. Of course, this will have a direct impact on operational efficiency and income in supermarkets and minimarkets. Therefore, we need a program or application that utilizes computer vision, such as object detection, to automatically detect what milk products are available on a minimarket or supermarket shelf.

## Results
### Model Performance
In this project we carried out several experiments and modifications using several models in yolov5, by changing the backbone architecture. After conducting a series of training data using the model we chose, we found that the Yolov5 model using the Resnet-50 architecture performed well using the dataset we had.

#### 1. Metrics

| model | epoch | learning_rate | batch_size | optimizer | Precision | Recall | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------| 
| Custom Yolov5s | 300 |  0.01 | 32 | SGD | 0.65 | 0.807 | 0.765 | 0.631 |
| MobileNet V3 | 300 | 0.01 | 32 | SGD | 0.577 | 0.699 | 0.691 | 0.57 |
| VGG-16 | 300 | 0.01 | 32 | SGD | 0.699 | 0.731 | 0.802 | 0.689 |
| **ResNet-50** | **100** | **0.01** | **32** | **SGD** | **0.734** | **0.776** | **0.823** | ***0.725** |

#### 2. Ablation Study
In this project we use the custom Yolov5 model using the architecture from Resnet50 which we got from [GitHub](https://github.com/WangRongsheng/BestYOLO). This repository provides a resnet50 model with the following architecture:
```
# Parameters
nc: 2  # number of classes
depth_multiple: 0.33  # model depth multiple
width_multiple: 0.25  # layer channel multiple
anchors:
  - [10,13, 16,30, 33,23]  # P3/8
  - [30,61, 62,45, 59,119]  # P4/16
  - [116,90, 156,198, 373,326]  # P5/32

# YOLOv5 v6.0 backbone
backbone:
  # [from, number, module, args]
  [[-1, 1, resnet501, [512]],  # 0
   [-1, 1, resnet502, [1024]],  # 1
   [-1, 1, resnet503, [2048]],  # 2
   [-1, 1, SPPF, [1024, 5]],  # 3
  ]

# YOLOv5 v6.0 head
head:
  [[-1, 1, Conv, [512, 1, 1]],
   [-1, 1, nn.Upsample, [None, 2, 'nearest']],
   [[-1, 1], 1, Concat, [1]],  # cat backbone P4
   [-1, 3, C3, [512, False]],  # 7

   [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 1, 1]],
   [-1, 1, nn.Upsample, [None, 2, 'nearest']],
   [[-1, 0], 1, Concat, [1]],  # cat backbone P3
   [-1, 3, C3, [256, False]],  # 11 (P3/8-small)

   [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 3, 2]],
   [[-1, 7], 1, Concat, [1]],  # cat head P4
   [-1, 3, C3, [512, False]],  # 14 (P4/16-medium)

   [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 3, 2]],
   [[-1, 3], 1, Concat, [1]],  # cat head P5
   [-1, 3, C3, [1024, False]],  # 17 (P5/32-large)

   [[11, 14, 17], 1, Detect, [nc, anchors]],  # Detect(P3, P4, P5)
  ]
```

in our model we modify the **nc** from ```nc:2``` to ```nc: {num_classes}``` and add **SPP** module, **BottleneckCSP** at the end of the backbone.

so the final backbone like this:
```
# YOLOv5 v6.0 backbone
backbone:
  # [from, number, module, args]
  [[-1, 1, resnet501, [512]],  # 0
   [-1, 1, resnet502, [1024]],  # 1
   [-1, 1, resnet503, [2048]],  # 2
   [-1, 1, SPPF, [1024, 5]],  # 5
   [-1, 1, SPP, [1024, [5, 9, 13]]],
   [-1, 3, BottleneckCSP, [1024, False]]
  ]
```

#### 3. Training/Validation Curve

In the training/validation curve above we can see that the model we built **fit** the dataset we created.
